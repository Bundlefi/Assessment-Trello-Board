# Trello Clone

Build a replica Trello task board. This assessment is meant to take **2-3 hours**. If you have any difficulties, note down any assumed approaches and continue moving forward to the best of your ability.

## **Functional Requirements**

- Users can add a new list (multiple) by clicking “Add another list”. 
  - By clicking “Add list”, the list will be persisted.
- Users can add a new card (multiple) inside a list by clicking “Add a card”. 
  - By clicking “Add card”, the card will be persisted.
- Users can cancel adding a new list or card by clicking an “X” button or by clicking out of the editting box.
- Users can drag any card to any column and reorder cards within the column.
- The lists should scroll horizontally for tablet and mobile screens (Mobile View).

## **Technical Requirements**

- Build this ontop of the NextJS framework. This uses React as it's main component Library.
- It is not required to use Typescript but would be excellent if you do.
- Clone this repo and identify your final branch for submittal.
- Implement using pure CSS (no CSS frameworks or libraries).
- Do not use a drag & drop JS library (i.e. react-draggable).
- Persist the boards lists and tasks.

## **Additional Notes**

- You do not have to create a database to persist the board's list and card data. However, come prepared to discuss how to persist if there were a backend DB and API.
- These designs are screenshots. Don’t worry about pixel-perfection, but do try to mimic the visual experience as much as you can.
- Support for editing and deleting tasks is not required for this assignment, but consider it a bonus if you have extra time
